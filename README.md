# OreSat "System controller" Board

## Overview

The System Controller (SC) baord is a robust, possibly RadHard control board that is in charge of all power control on the satellite. It talks serial to the Low Gain Radio (LGR) as well as to the payload. It also has power switches with circuit breakers ("efuses") that control all of the other systems.
